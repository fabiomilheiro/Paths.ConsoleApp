# Paths.ConsoleApp
Someone asked to list directories with the '\' characters sitting on the same columns e.g.

    C:\Tests            \Test 1       \somefile.txt
    C:\Tests            \Test 2       \somefile.txt
    C:\Tests            \Test 100     \somefile.txt
    C:\Photos and videos\Holidays 2018\somefile.txt
